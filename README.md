🌱 Crop Recommendation System
------------------------------------

A Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.

📌 Project Overview

This system predicts the best crop to cultivate using the following input parameters:

Nitrogen (N) , Phosphorus (P) , Potassium (K) , Temperature , Humidity , pH value , Rainfall

The model analyzes these features and recommends the optimal crop for maximum yield and productivity.

🚀 Features

User-friendly input system

Accurate crop prediction using ML algorithms

Fast and efficient results

Can be integrated with a web interface or GUI



🛠️ Technologies Used

Python , Scikit-learn , Pandas , NumPy , Matplotlib (for visualization) , Flask


⚙️ How It Works

Preprocess the soil and climate dataset.

Train a Machine Learning model.

Save the trained model.

Provide input values to get crop prediction.
